    <!-- Example 1: Using an Image from the Web -->
    <img
      src="https://www.seiu1000.org/sites/main/files/main-images/camera_lense_0.jpeg"   
      title="camera lense" 
      width="1000"
      alt="A Camera Lens"
    />
    <!-- 
        This <img> element displays an image sourced from the web. 
        The 'src' attribute specifies the URL of the image.
        The 'alt' attribute provides a description for the image.
    -->

    <!-- Example 2: Using an Image from Your Local Files -->
    <img 
      src="img/im1.jpg"
      width="1000" 
      alt="A Girl With her Camera" />
    <!-- 
        This <img> element displays an image stored locally in the 'img' directory.
        The 'src' attribute specifies the relative path to the image file.
        The 'alt' attribute provides a description for the image.
    -->

    <!-- Explanation: -->
    <!-- 
        The 'src' attribute stands for "source" and is used to specify the location (URL or path) of the image file.
        The 'alt' attribute stands for "alternative text" and is used to provide a description of the image. 
        This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, aiding accessibility and providing context.
        Make sure to use meaningful 'alt' text to describe the content and purpose of the image.

    <!-- Example 3: Using the 'title' Attribute for Image Tooltip -->
    <img 
      src="img/logo.webp" 
      title="This is My Logo" 
      width="1000"
      alt="Company Logo" />
    <!-- 
        This <img> element displays an image of a company logo.
        The 'src' attribute specifies the relative path to the image file.
        The 'alt' attribute provides alternative text for the image.
        The 'title' attribute adds a tooltip that displays when the user hovers over the image.
        The 'title' attribute is a global attribute and can be used with various HTML elements to provide additional information.
        In this case, the tooltip informs users that the image represents the company logo.
    -->

    <!-- Explanation: -->
    <!-- 
        The 'title' attribute provides supplementary information about an element when the user interacts with it. 
        It's often used for tooltips, which are small pop-up boxes that appear when the user hovers over the element.
        While the 'alt' attribute is essential for accessibility (screen readers for visually impaired users), 
        the 'title' attribute is more for enhancing the user experience.
        Remember that the 'title' attribute content is displayed as a tooltip only when the user hovers over the element.
