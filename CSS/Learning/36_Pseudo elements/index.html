    <h1>M7TROJAN</h1>
    <p class="colored-first-line">
        This is the first line of the paragraph. The rest of the text continues to explain more details. 
        It spans multiple lines to demonstrate how only the first line will be styled with a different color.
        Every sentence after the first line will retain the default styling, showing the effect of the 
        ::first-line pseudo-element.
